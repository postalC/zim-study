====== 2. Feature Types ======
Created Saturday 15 October 2016

There are many **synonymous** names for features. The background of the speaker, as well as the context of the conversation usually dictates which term is used:
* Attribute - Features are a quantitative attributes of the samples being observed
* Axis - Features are orthogonal axes of their feature space, if they are linearly independent
* Column - Features are represented as columns in your dataset
* Dimension - A dataset's features, grouped together can be treated as a n-dimensional coordinate space
* Input - Feature values are the input of data-driven, machine learning algorithms
* Predictor - Features used to predict other attributes are called predictors
* View - Each feature conveys a quantitative trait or perspective about the sample being observed
* Independent Variable - Autonomous features used to calculate others are like independent variables in algebraic equations


Although they have many names, any given feature will fall into one of two types:

===== Continuous Features =====
In the case of continuous features, there exist a measurable difference between possible feature values. Feature values usually are also a subset of all real numbers:
* Distance
* Time
* Cost
* Temperature


===== Categorical Features =====
With categorical features, there is a specified number of discrete, possible feature values. These values may or may not have ordering to them. If they do have a natural ordering, they are called **ordinal categorical features**. Otherwise if there is no intrinsic ordering, they are called **nominal categorical features**.

==== Nominal ====
* Car Models
* Colors

==== Ordinal ====
* High-Medium-Low
* 1-10 Years Old, 11-20 Years Old, 30-40 Years Old
