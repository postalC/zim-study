In this lesson, you'll learn how to intuitively select of a subset of data out of your dataframes or series, an operation known as **indexing**. More than half of the top-voted StackOverflow questions on Pandas revolve around this single topic! This shows you how important and potentially confusing indexing can be. Spend adequate time working through this chapter and playing around with the accompanying dataset.

Learning to properly indexing is like learning the ABC's, so if you have a gap in your indexing knowledge, it'll be hard to complete future tasks. But if you're able to master this, you'll have mastered the building blocks of all future material. To get you accustomed to indexing, first use the .read_csv() method you just learned about to load up the direct_marketing.csv file in your course /Module2/Datasets/ directory: 

'''
which pip2.7
$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ sudo python2.7 get-pip.py
'''


'''
import pandas as pd
>>> df = pd.read_csv('Datasets/direct_marketing.csv')
>>> df
