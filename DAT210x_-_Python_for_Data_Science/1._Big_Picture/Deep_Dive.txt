====== Deep Dive ======
Created Friday 14 October 2016

===== Dive Deeper =====

In this module, you learned the big picture behind what data science, data analysis, and machine learning really are, and then took a closer peek at the data analysis process. As you progress through each lecture and especially at the end of each module, remember to jot down a few notes on your course map. There should already be a few important annotations on it:
* Collecting: Have a data driven question.
* Collecting: The types of questions and problems solvable with machine learning.
* Collecting: Collect as much data as you possibly can, focusing on samples.
* Modeling: Unsupervised, and supervised learning, and how they're different.

In the future, we won't summarize the points so be sure to take notes as you go! Another good idea is to start a running log of problems you want to solve. Just keep jotting them down as you think of them, and you'll have a backlog of cool ideas to tackle in the future. With a firmly defined problem you want to squash, you'll be better posed to hunt for related data.

The quizzes that go with each lecture are intended to ensure you have a firm grasp on the topic covered. Taking them will help you keep the knowledge you've gained. And finally, each module will have a dive deeper section like this one, with extra resources you can use to further hone your skills, time permitting.
